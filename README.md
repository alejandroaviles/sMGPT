Mathematica routines to compute the RSD power spectrum for biased tracers in Modified Gravity models

#

Run the the notebooks 0_All.nb in folders code/ and codeNW/. Then, run the file multipoles.nb.

The input power spectra should be located in input/ where you can find a code PNW.nb to compute the non-wiggle power spectrum.

In the modules code/0_params.m and codeNW/0_params.m you should specify the route to the power spectra with and without wiggles. There you can specify the kind of perturbative kernels used. 

Please contact me for any doubt.

The code is based mainly in

Alejandro Aviles, Georgios Valogiannis, Mario A.Rodriguez-Meza, Jorge L. Cervantes-Cota, Baojiu Li & Rachel Bean, Redshift space power spectrum beyond Einstein-de Sitter kernels, JCAP04(2021)039, https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.05077

It uses SPT kernels obtained from a mapping of the LPT kernels of:

Alejandro Aviles & Jorge L. Cervantes-Cota, Lagrangian perturbation theory for modified gravity, Phys. Rev. D 96, 123526 (2017). https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.05077

You can use and mofify this code as long as you cite at least the first paper above.
