Routines to compute the RSD power spectrum for biased tracers in Modified Gravity models

#

Run the the files 0_All.nb in folders code/ and codeNW/

The input power spectra should be located in input/ where you can find a code PNW.nb to compute the non-wiggle power spectrum.

Please contact me for any doubt.

The code is based mainly in

It uses SPT kernels obtained from a mapping of the LPT kernels of:
